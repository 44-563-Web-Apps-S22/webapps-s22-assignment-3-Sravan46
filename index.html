    The sea is one of the most beautiful blessings for man,
    <b>which shows the greatness of the Creator.</b> Words canâ€™t describe the sea beauty and charm, 
    which is an inspiration to many poets and writers. Poems and thoughts that talked about sea are uncountable.
    The beach is my favorite place. <b>Sit down to relax and think.</b> I also go to it to practice many 
    activities and games.
    I join my friends in playing treasure hunt in the sand, which is based on hiding various 
    objects down the sand and writing instructions on paper cards to help others reach them.

    <h1>Dynamic Programming (</h1>
    <p>
        Dynamic Programming (commonly referred to as DP) is an algorithmic technique for solving a problem
         by recursively breaking it down into simpler subproblems and using the fact that the optimal solution
          to the overall problem depends upon the optimal solution to it's individual subproblems.
